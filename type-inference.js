// /*
// One of the first things we‚Äôll discover with TypeScript is that when we declare a variable with an initial value, the variable can never be reassigned a value of a different data type. This is an example of type inference: everywhere in our program, TypeScript expects the data type of the variable to match the type of the value initially assigned to it at declaration.
//
//     TypeScript recognizes JavaScript‚Äôs built-in ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù data types:
//
//     boolean
// number
// null
// string
// undefined
// If we try to reassign a variable to a value of a different type, TypeScript will surface an error.
//
//     let order = 'first';
//
// order = 1;
// Running the TypeScript code above will result in the following error being surfaced in the terminal: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
//
//     TypeScript‚Äôs type system is telling us that order is expected to be the primitive type string, but we‚Äôre trying to assign it a value of type number. That‚Äôs not allowed: variables can only be assigned the types expected by the type system.
//
// We can fix this complaint by changing the new value to be the expected string type:
//
// let order = 'first';
//
// order = '1';
// Let‚Äôs practice!*/
// 1.
// Our code has a bug! üôÄ When we run our JavaScript code in index.js (node index.js), it prints NaN years instead of the expected 28 years.
//
//     Use the tsc command to run the index.ts file and surface any type errors.
// 2.
// It looks like we‚Äôre assigning the wrong type of data to realAge.
//
//     Change the assigned value of realAge to be the expected value with the correct type.
var aged = true;
var realAge = 0;
if (aged) {
    // Previously was "realAge = '4 years';"
    realAge = 4;
}
var dogAge = realAge * 7;
console.log("".concat(dogAge, " years"));
