# typescript-exercises

This repository contains the lessons I am going through with Codecademy's TypeScript course. The different directories represent the different topics I've learned and pushed so far. Within the directories, you can find the different code I've written through the lessons. With this I intend to be able to learn TypeScript along with its documentation.
